## Prerequisites

You'll need the following:
* [IBM Cloud account](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/)
* [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Run the app locally

Install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file to be able to run the app locally.

You can optionally use a virtual environment to avoid having these dependencies clash with those of other Python projects or your operating system.
  ```
pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

Run the app.
  ```
python api.py
  ```

 View your app at: http://localhost:8000

## Prepare the app for deployment

To deploy to IBM Cloud, it can be helpful to set up a manifest.yml file. 

The manifest.yml includes basic information about your app, such as the name, how much memory to allocate for each instance and the route. In this manifest.yml **random-route: true** generates a random route for your app to prevent your route from colliding with others.  You can replace **random-route: true** with **host: myChosenHostName**, supplying a host name of your choice. [Learn more...](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/manageapps/depapps.html#appmanifest)
 ```
 applications:
 - name: GetStartedPython
   random-route: true
   memory: 128M
 ```

## Deploy the app

You can use the Cloud Foundry CLI to deploy apps.

Choose your API endpoint
   ```
cf api <API-endpoint>
   ```

Replace the *API-endpoint* in the command with an API endpoint from the following list.

|URL                             |Region          |
|:-------------------------------|:---------------|
| https://api.ng.bluemix.net     | US South       |
| https://api.eu-de.bluemix.net  | Germany        |
| https://api.eu-gb.bluemix.net  | United Kingdom |
| https://api.au-syd.bluemix.net | Sydney         |

Login to your IBM Cloud account

  ```
cf login
  ```

From within the project root directory push your app to IBM Cloud
  ```
cf push
  ```

This can take a minute. If there is an error in the deployment process you can use the command `cf logs <Your-App-Name> --recent` to troubleshoot.

When deployment completes you should see a message indicating that your app is running.  View your app at the URL listed in the output of the push command.  You can also issue the
  ```
cf apps
  ```
  command to view your apps status and see the URL.
